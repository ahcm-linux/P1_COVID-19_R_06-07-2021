Legends for the tables generated as output from the script.R file of folder 'codes'. TabA1 shows the main
results of the data analysis, while TabS1 shows supplementary results. The text of TabA2 serves to describe results
for the models fitted for each analyte. In TabA2, replace [...] by the name of the analyte. 

[TabA1] (Sample results) Sample description. Number of alive and dead COVID-19 patients in the sample split by gender.

[TabS1] (Inferential results) Parameter estimates and related confidence intervals (CIs) for the Linear Mixed Model (LMM)
	fitted for the analyte [...]. The column Predictors shows all independent variables (iv's) entering the LMM.
	Interactions between iv's are represented by the symbol (:). For the Gender and Outcome categorical iv's, the
	categories of refference for the model are shown between square brackets. The Time iv is continuous and was
	modeled through a B-spline basis matrix for a polynomial spline of degree 3. Estimates for the 1st 2nd and 3rd
	splines terms are shown in the table. Bootstrap CIs, with 95% confidence level, are shown for each estimate.
	CIs not including the value zero are highlithed with the symbol (*), and indicate statistically significant
	variables for the model. Bootstrap CIs were based on 1000 bootstrap resamples.
