__FigA1:__ (Sample results) Sample trajectories of COVID-19 pacients. Grey lines indicates individual trajectories. 
	Median trajectories are shown for males and females along with shaded areas representing the interquartile
	range of observed values. Interquartile range = difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.

__FigA2:__ (Sample results) Sample trajectories of COVID-19 pacients. Grey lines indicates individual trajectories. 
	Median trajectories are shown for alive and dead pacients along with shaded areas representing the
	interquartile range of observed values. Interquartile range = difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.

__FigA3:__ (Inferential results) Time trends of analytes concentration in males and females COVID-19 patients.
	Dots represent observed data. Colored lines represent mean predictions of analytes for males and females
	COVID-19 patients (including dead and alive patients). Shaded areas represent assymptotic confidence intervals
	with 95% confidence level. Results are based on independent Linear Mixed Models (LMM) fitted for
	each analyte, as described in the Section of Statistical Methods.

__FigA4:__ (Inferential results) Time trends of analytes concentration in alive and dead COVID-19 patients.
	Dots represent observed data. Colored lines represent mean predictions of analytes for alive and dead
	COVID-19 patients (including males and females patients). Shaded areas represent assymptotic confidence intervals
	with 95% confidence level. Results are based on independent Linear Mixed Models (LMM) fitted for
	each analyte, as described in the Section of Statistical Methods.

__FigS1:__ (Sample results) Representativiness of males, females and dead pacients in the sample at each time point.
	Gender (percentage) = percentage of males at each time point. Gender (count) = number of males and females
	at each time point. Outcome (percentage) = percentage of dead pacitents at each time point.
	Outcome (count) = number of dead pacients at each time point.

__FigS2:__ (Inferential results) Time trends of analytes concentration in COVID-19 patients. Dots represent observed data.
	Grey lines represent mean predictions of analytes for COVID-19 patients (including males, females, dead and
	alive patients). Shaded areas represent assymptotic confidence intervals with 95% confidence level. Results
	are based on independent Linear Mixed Models (LMM) fitted for each analyte, as described in the
	Section of Statistical Methods.
