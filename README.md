# Presentation

This repository hosts the source code, resources e results of a statistical data analysis performed in the R software (version 4.0.3).

## Objectives

To perform a longitudinal analysis of the levels of clinical analytes recorded for COVID-19 patients, comparing the average trends for males and females, survivors and non-survivors.

## The data

The dataset includes 237 COVID-19 patients from the brazilian hospital Hospital Sírio-Libanês (HSL). The data source can be downloaded from the link [HSL data](https://repositoriodatasharingfapesp.uspdigital.usp.br/handle/item/97) (last accessed in August 2020).

Five clinical analytes were selected for the statistical analysis: erythrocytes, platelets, monocytes, neutrophils and leukocytes. The number of males, females, surviving and non-surviving patients are given in the following table:

| Gender | Outcome | Count |
| :----- | :------ | ----: |
| Female | Alive   | 82    |
| Female | Dead    | 1     |
| Male   | Alive   | 148   |
| Male   | Dead    | 6     |

# Reproducing the data analysis

The R software version >= 4.0.3 is needed for reproducing the data analysis (download it freely from the link [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/)).

Follow the steps described below to reproduce the data analysis from source code:

1. Download this repository to a folder on your computer
2. Open R version >= 4.0.3 and define the folder you download as your working directory (_c.f._ [defining working directory on R-Studio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711843-Working-Directories-and-Workspaces))
3. Open de R file named [script.R](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/blob/main/codes/script.R) located in the folder named [__codes__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/codes)
4. Run all the script (_c.f._ [executing code in R-Studio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484448-Editing-and-Executing-Code))

If the previous steps were correctly performed, the results of the data analysis (figures and tables) should be saved on the subdirectories of the folder [__outputs__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/outputs).

# Repository folders

The following folders are in this repository:

* [__codes__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/codes) - folder including the three R files necessary for reproducing the data analysis
* [__data__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/data) - folder including the datasets selected for data analysis
* [__legends__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/legends) - folder including legends for figures and tables
* [__outputs__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/outputs) - folder including outputs generated by the file [script.R](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/blob/main/codes/script.R)
* [__statistical-methods__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/statistical-methods) - folder including descriptions of the statistical methods used in the data analysis and main R packages used 

The folders [__outputs/figures/png/__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/outputs/png) and [__outputs/figures/pdf/__](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/tree/main/outputs/pdf) are empty. To get figures in png or pdf format you need to run the [script.R](https://github.com/ahcm-linux/P2-R_COVID-19_2021/blob/main/codes/script.R) file following the steps described in the previous section.
